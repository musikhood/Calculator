## Description

It's basic calculator app with three different themes and ability to control with keyboard.\
I also added local storage, so when you leave or refresh this website your desired theme will be saved.\
I created this app to test my redux/typescript skills and I'm very happy with the results. \
App is available there: <a href="https://musikhood.github.io/Calculator/" target="_blank" >Link</a>
